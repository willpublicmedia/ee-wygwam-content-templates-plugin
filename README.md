Custom Content Templates add-on for the WYGWAM/CKeditor field in ExpressionEngine CMS

Here's a version of Content Templates for the ExpressionEngine WYGWAM field, which is based on CKEditor. I customized this code to match markup and styles from Bootstrap 3.2.2, with some additional classes used on will.illinois.edu.

Mike Mella (@mikemella) has provided an excellent screencast showing how to use and customize these files, which you can find here: http://belikewater.ca/blog/entry/wygwam-templates/. Mike was kind enough to provide his example files as a starting point, which I customized for this repo.

I’m using this for the ExpressionEngine CMS, and most of Mike’s screencast relates to implementation using the Pixel & Tonic add-on field type WYGWAM. But the basic idea, and the files in this repo, should work with any other implementation of CKEditor.
